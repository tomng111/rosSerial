# ROS Serial - Blinking LED
This is a fork of the original code from <ins>docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Writing-A-Simple-Py-Publisher-And-Subscriber.html</ins> and the famous rosserial-ROS1 (<ins>wiki.ros.org/rosserial</ins>), with some changes.<br />
An Arduino Mega board is used as the hardware where the blinking LED is actually happening.<br /><br />
ROS2 Humble - Arduino Mega 2560.<br />
